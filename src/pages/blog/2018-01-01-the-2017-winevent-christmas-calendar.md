### 10. [Chateau de Romance - Bordeaux Blanc 2015](https://www.everythingwine.ca/chateau-de-romance-bordeaux-blanc-2015-750ml)

Year: 2015
Grapes: Semillon, Sauvignon
Region: Bordeaux, France

* butter
* honey
* pineapple
* pear

Caleigh - 69 - that’s buttery pee. It may be better cold. Let’s put ice in it.

Stephen - 72 - I like it! Crisp and dry.

Fun Fact: We threw ice cubes in this but it gets 91 points from James Suckling.

### 09. [Santa Rita 120 Hero's Salute Red Blend](https://www.everythingwine.ca/santa-rita-120-triple-c)

Year: 2016
Grapes: Carmenere, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon
Region: Central Valley, Chile

* clay
* blackberry
* cherry
* jam

Caleigh - 76 - sophisticated grandma pie.

Ryan - 70 - Better with chips.

Stephen - 79 - hits your mouth like fruit water. Like gramma stole 50 cents Vitamin Water recipes and mixed in her blackberry pie. Then the tannis hit you and you’re certain it’s not water and taste some Chilean clay. Smooth and light finish but the tannins stick with you. Goes well with Ruffles chips… anything goes well with Ruffles chips.

### 08. Michael David Petite Petit

Year: 2014
Grapes: Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot
Region: Lodi, USA

* chocolate
* cherry
* blackberry
* leather
* coffee

Caleigh - 81 - Sophisticated. Blackberry and a bit of tobacco.

Stephen - 79 - Coffee and chocolate. Leather. Great end of night after a meat dish.

### 07. Famiglia Pasqua - Passione e Sentimento - Romeo & Juliet

Year: 2015
Grapes: Merlot, Corvina, Croatina
Region: Veneto, Italy

* boysenberry
* various fruits

Caleigh - 77 - Sour berries. 

Stephen - 3.9 - Summery red wine. Very fruit forward. Hints of boysenberry. It’s almost too strong for me, it’s a little too strong in terms of fruit.

Later in the night I changed this to a 4.1.. It definitely grows on you after a glass or two.

Fun Fact: The label depicts the famous wall of love near the Romeo & Juliet balcony in Verona where thousands of love messages have been inscribed over the years

### 06. [Chateau Pey La Tour Reserve Bordeaux Superieur](https://www.everythingwine.ca/chateau-pey-la-tour-reserve)

Year: 2014
Grapes: Bordeaux
Region: Bordeaux, France

* prune
* leather
* smoke
* ground coffee

Caleigh - 81 - pretty manly. Cause it’s smokey and coffee. That’s all.

Barb - 87 - I quite like it. Definitely smokey, I don’t know about coffee.

Stephen - 88 - tastes like a leather cloth was soaked in wine, chocolate, and fig juice and then hung on a smoke rack.. then dabbed on my tongue after some swirls of berry flavour.

### 05. Hatchchild Cabernet Sauvignon

Year: 2013
Grapes: Cabernet Sauvignon
Region: Okanagan Valley, BC

* chocolate
* blackberry
* wood

Caleigh - 86 - it’s nice, I like it. Like I dipped a blackberry in chocolate and then put it in a wood box, and then you ate it the next day. Nice and smooth, not very full-bodied.

Stephen - 84 - It’s an adult wine. Maybe a little hint of coffee as well.

### 04. [19 Crimes Shiraz, Durif](https://www.everythingwine.ca/19-crimes-shiraz-durif)

Year: ???
Grapes: Red Blend
Region: South Australia, Australia

* unknown

Fun Fact: Download the 19 Crimes iPhone app and the picture will come to life and tell you about this individual’s crime.

### 03. [Bodegas Volver Single Vineyard Tempranillo](https://www.everythingwine.ca/jorge-ordonez-volver-tempranillo-750ml)

Year: 2014
Grapes: Tempranillo
Region: La Mancha, Spain

* clay
* blueberry
* oak

Caleigh - 84 - got some pizazz. Drink it on a hot summer’s day with a nice steak or spanish meaty tapas.

Stephen - 90 - I’d probably rate this 92 if it was aged a little more than the 3 years. It hits you with some harsh tannins that let you know it’s had a gnarly life in the arid La Mancha region. Packs a punch on its own but this wine needs to be eaten with some meat and flavour. Caleigh’s right: Spanish tapas or Thanksgiving dinner. I’d age this sucker and pull it out in the Fall for a night out or a BBQ with friends.

### 02. McLaren Vale Serafino Shiraz

Year: 2015
Grapes: Shiraz
Region: McLaren Vale, South Australia

* cherry
* chocolate
* vanilla
* oak
* black pepper

Caleigh - 89 - really nice and smooth. Easy drinking and could share it with friends. Seems to pair well with different foods. Reminds me of slipping into a Kate Spade Blanket, equal smoothness.

Stephen - 90 - very big fan of this wine. 2014/15 show good grapes and McV has produced a silky smooth, yet oaky and fruit-filled Shiraz that pairs well with some burger or other game.

Fun to drink alone, as it’s simplicity doesn’t demand pairing or guests, but can easily live up to a dinner party purchase. More barrel than earth, and more smooth than complex, I’m a big fan and if the price ever dropped slightly I’d be tempted to grab a case and age it.

### 01. Chateau Coussin Sainte Victoire Rose

Year: 2016
Grapes: Grenache / Cinsault / Syrah
Region: Cotes de Provence, France

* blossoms
* butter
* lemon
* white flowers

Caleigh - 90 - reminds me of that Cedar Creek Wine. Delicate and balanced, very ladylike.

Ron - 83 - this is an excellent choice for seafood, chicken, well-balanced and fragrant. No hint of oak.

Steven - 91 - roses are garbage combos of sweetness; usually. So although I’m not a fan of roses overall, this deserves an extra special rating of 91 because it’s actually very good.

It’s a Steely Dan.. very balanced.. Whitewash up front, and a little balanced acidity to follow with the finish. Notes of butter and blossoms.. Tastes like it was made by robots.. cold and stainless steel.
